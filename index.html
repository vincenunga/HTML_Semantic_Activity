                    <h3>Our Story</h3>
                    <p>
                        At Team Seas, our journey began with a shared vision of protecting our planet's most precious resource ‚Äì our oceans.<br>
                        We believe that collectively, we can make a significant impact and preserve the beauty and diversity of our marine<br>
                        ecosystems for generations to come.
                    </p>
                
                    <p>
                        Our story started when a group of passionate individuals from diverse backgrounds came together, united by a common<br>
                        purpose: to combat the pressing issue of marine pollution. Witnessing the devastating effects of plastic waste and<br>
                        pollution on our oceans, we knew we had to take action. Inspired by the success of our predecessors at Team Trees,<br>
                        we set out to create a movement that would address the urgent need for cleaner, healthier seas.
                    </p>
                
                    <p>
                        Driven by this mission, we launched Team Seas, a global initiative that brings people, organizations, and influencers<br>
                        together to remove trash from our oceans and coastlines. We set an ambitious goal to remove 30 million pounds<br>
                        (about 13.6 million kilograms) of garbage from the ocean by the end of 2025. Our story is one of hope, determination,<br>
                        and collaboration, as we work tirelessly to protect and restore the beauty of our marine world.
